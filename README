Dijkstra's algorithm homework assignment #3 

The longest shortest path is located in the text file named "sampleRoute.txt" 
General Statistics of that single given route: 
Arrival Time: 674 
Total Time enroute: 64 hours 
Total Time waiting on a planet: 393

Longest-shortest path was very inefficient with this specific route just based on arrival time. 

Here is the longest-shortest path based on total time:  
Mayflower	Bespin	12	Hoth	16
Mayflower	Hoth	20	Sullust	42
Mayflower	Sullust	46	Yavin	63
Mayflower	Yavin	67	Endor	77
Mayflower	Endor	81	Corellia	98
Titanic	Corellia	159	Bakura	211
Wonderwoman	Bakura	406	Corporate Sector	466
Wonderwoman	Corporate Sector	470	Hapes Cluster	477
Wonderwoman	Hapes Cluster	481	Kessel	493
Wonderwoman	Kessel	497	Mon Calamari	506

Arrival Time: 506 hours
Total Time enroute: 210 hours
Total time waiting on a planet (Includes the 4-hour layover): 283 hours 
This can be located in the "AllItineraries.txt" file. 

The "AllItineraries.txt" is a file generated from the program used for validation on all routes running Dijkstra's. The lines of code generating this file are commented out but are still present in the source code if you wish to view them. See Galaxy::search() for further details. It contains all itineraries of every pairs of planets. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILDING AND RUNNING THE PROGRAM: 
To BUILD: open up a terminal in the same folder and execute the following: ./BUILD 
To RUN: In the same terminal execute the following: ./RUN <time_constraints_file> <ship_routes_file> 
--> For this given version of the program, it would be: ./RUN conduits.txt ship_routes.txt 
This will print out the longest shortest path of every planet in the galaxy. 
Script that does all of this: ./RUN_ROUTES 
--> However, this will only work for the given conduits.txt and ship_routes.txt files located in the same folder.
